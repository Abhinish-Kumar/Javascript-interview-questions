MDN:- The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.


```javascript

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Delayed for 1 second.");
}, 1000);


```

The two primary timer functions are **setTimeout** and **setInterval**, along with their corresponding cancellation functions, **clearTimeout** and **clearInterval**
